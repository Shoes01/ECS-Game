# SOULS OUTLINE
Races grant baseline stats.
Souls grants additional stats.
Souls are dropped by monsters.
Some items contain souls.
> Mainly these will be life giving faeries (Ã  la Zelda with the faeries?)
Souls can be consumed to increase power.
Souls are not uniform in their stat distribution.

## MECHANIC ONE
Souls grant additional stats.
> HP, ATK, DEF, MAG, RES, SPD
>>> HP here is HP_Max

## MECHANIC TWO
Souls can be consumed.
> Combining souls will raise some stats, lower others. The net increase will be noted.
> The player may rotate the soul before combining

## MECHANIC THREE
Souls have eccentricity that determine how the stats are spread.
> Circular, Oval, Parabolic, Hyperbolic
> Eccentricity is tied to race

## MECHANIC FOUR
Souls can be found in jars.
> Because HP is tied to this, there has to be an easy way to gain HP.
>>> Soul Jars containing faeries will grant HP.

## MECHANIC FIVE (?)
Souls can be combined with other souls.
> A soul has 6 attributes; a soul can be merged into another one in order to replace one of the negative attributes.
OR
> Monsters drop soul shards of certain attributes, and the player needs to combine them into a full soul before consuming it.
