# SKILL OUTLINE
Skills will be bestowed by items.
Skills can be mastered, like in FTTA.
Skills have levels, like in Disgaea.

## MECHANIC ONE
Skills can be leveled

## MECHANIC TWO
Skills will consume parts of the stats of the player.
> Higher leveled skills will consume more stats of the player, but the consumption will be more efficient.

## MECHANIC THREE
Skills will have restrictions that scale with their power.
> Higher leveled skills might have a greater AoE that needs to be free of obstacles.
\\ Skills can be mastered many times? Does one item grant all the variations? \\

## MECHANIC FOUR
Items bestow skills, and can be mastered.
> Once the item is unequipped, the mastered skill remains usable.
Items may bestow more than one skill, but from different classes.

## MECHANIC FIVE
Skills can only be mastered if their prequisites are met
[Swords_I]  -- [Parry_I]
[Shields_I] /

## MECHANIC SIX
Skills will belong to slots, just like items.
Skills must be equipped in their slots.

## MECHANIC SEVEN
Races will have access to classes, classes will have access to skills.
Caveat: It will be possible to combine skills in ways that "don't make sense", such as having a ranged "steady shot" be used with a melee weapon.

## MECHANIC EIGHT
Items can only be equipped by certain classes.
Each race will be able to equip every item, but the class restrictions may change.
Example: Human Soldier and Orc Beserker would each wear the same armor.

## MECHANIC NINE
Class requirements are: having mastered X amount of skills from Y classes, and having Z amount of points in specific stats.
Being a certain class ties up the Z stat points, like Sustain skills from ToME.
